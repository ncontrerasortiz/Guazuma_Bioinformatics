This file has a snippet of text in it. We are going to use it to change words in it,
and learn how to do substitutions of words. Some words we want to change, some words
we want to keep, and some we don't consider at all.
Here are some more lines of text. These lines also contain words, some of which we
will change, and some of which we will keep. Sometimes, we have to look at the text
before we know which words we want to keep and which words we need to substitute.
For that, it is helpful to use cat or more or less, or you can just use vim to read
the file. 
For now, let's just look at the words that we have. Let's choose which lines we want
to change and let's focus on those. We might want to keep some of the words in some
of the paragraphs, so note which lines we want to change and which we want to keep
constant.
This is the last paragraph. There aren't a lot of words here, but we should still
make sure that we check if we want to change some of them.
