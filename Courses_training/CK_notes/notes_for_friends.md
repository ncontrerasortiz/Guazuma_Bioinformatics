#Bioinformatics tips

1. Always google, everything. Copy and paste exact errors in google or duckduckgo. How to's... be careful to copy and paste solutions blindlessly, try to understand (superficially) what is happening (don't want to mess deep computer configs, or install corrupted software... etc)

2. Always read the docs, at least superficially

3. Learn languages, not necessary to the fullest, but some useful bits (bash, markdown, python?, R)

4. organice work (there's no correct one, just the one that fits you best)
	- google different strategies to organice bioinformatic projects: trial and error
	- use text editors (sublime, notepad++) not word, office! jupyter notebooks (different languages, notebooks)
	- notes and commands: always write every step, all steps detailed, don't trust memory...
	- organice folders and files, names (readme files)
	- create readme files to explain what each folder contains

5. Backup: onedrive, external drives, github (only for code files, not sequences or big files), many many other

6. Common commands: keyboard up-down arrows, `history`, Tab to complete,
`rm` remove forever
`cp` copy
`mv` move
Structure: cp and mv: `mv file1 file2` 

 `*`/`.`, `nano`, `cd`, `pwd`, `ls -lt -h`, `top` (then exit q), `cat file` (`| head or tail -#oflines`)
