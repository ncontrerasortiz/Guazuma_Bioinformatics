This is a short snippet of text. There are a lot of words in this text
that you can search. You should look for the word text and see how many
times it appears. Use the forward slash to look for the word text. Use n
and N to cycle between hits. You can also use the hashtag to look for 
the current word under the cursor. Remember that the patterns are case
sensitive.

Now we have another small snippet of text that contains some zebras. Some of the zebras have 
been changed to the zebra "zebra" and we need to change them back.
But you should make sure that you change the correct zebras. For example, you
should keep the zebra between the quotes before, and you should 
keep it in this sentence too. But you should change all other instances so that you have
the zebra "zebra" in the correct place.
